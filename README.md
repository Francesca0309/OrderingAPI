# OrderingAPI

The solution contains the Ordering RESTful Web Api implemented in .NET Core 2.1, along with tests.
The client library is used to consume the API and the ClientSample project contains an integration example.
Documentation for the API was created using Swagger and it is presented on the launch page of the API project.
Unit testing uses Moq.
